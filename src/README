2. Building Sion Tower for Linux 
================================

If you don't have Ogre3D installed you must perform the following steps:

-   Install Ogre dependencies:

    sudo apt-get install g++ make libfreetype6-dev libboost-date-time-dev \ 
    libboost-thread-dev nvidia-cg-toolkit libfreeimage-dev zlib1g-dev \ 
    libzzip-dev libois-dev libcppunit-dev doxygen libxt-dev libxaw7-dev \
    libxxf86vm-dev libxrandr-dev libglu-dev cmake

-   Download Ogre sourcecode http://www.ogre3d.org/download/source

-   Decompress Ogre sourcecode package

-   Build a platform dependent makefile with cmake, build using make and
    install:
  
    cmake .
    make
    sudo make install
    
    
Now you must install OIS, SDL and SDL Mixer:

    sudo apt-get install libois-dev libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev
    
Download and install MyGUI:

-   Download it from here https://sourceforge.net/projects/my-gui/files/MyGUI/MyGUI_3.2.0_RC1/

-   Decompress the package

-   Build MyGUI:

    cmake .
    make
    sudo make install
    
Build Sion Tower using make:

    make
    
An executable file named siontower will be created.



3. Running Sion Tower on Linux
==============================

To run Sion Tower on Linux you must copy some Ogre plugins and the Open
GL render system into the plugins folder. Those files are usually
located inside the /usr/local/lib/OGRE folder:

    cp /usr/local/lib/OGRE/Plugin* plugins
    cp /usr/local/lib/OGRE/RenderSystem_GL.so plugins
    
Now you can run Sion Tower:

    ./siontower
